Description
-----------
Yet another **Flappy Bird** recreation, which is based on [**Phaser**][1] (An awesome HTML 5 Game Engine).

Copyright
---------
Most assets come from [here][2], as mentioned by that repository, the copyright belongs to the original **Flabby Bird** author. 

The rest is from the Internet. 

My project is merely for coding practice.
